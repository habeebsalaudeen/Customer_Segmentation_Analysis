# Customer_Segmentation_Analysis
Customer segmentation project that analyses e-commerce transactions, builds RFM features, applies K-Means clustering, visualises clusters, and provides actionable marketing recommendations (loyalty, re-engagement, upsell/bundles). This repo contains the analysis code, visualisations, and Power BI dashboards for interactive exploration.


## Overview
This project focuses on **customer segmentation** for an e-commerce business, using **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis** and **K-Means clustering** to identify distinct customer groups. The goal is to tailor marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and increase sales and revenue.
